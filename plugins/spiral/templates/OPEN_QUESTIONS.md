# Open Questions

Questions here block or influence implementation.

> **Critical convention.** Every question must include a `Recommended default:` line. The loop ships under that default and leaves the question open for override. Do not block the loop on dev sign-off. Stress-tested values that survive multiple iterations get frozen.

## How to add a new question

```
## Q-NNN: Short title

- Context: one or two sentences on why this is a decision point.
- Options:
  - A. Option A description.
  - B. Option B description.
  - C. Option C description.
- Recommended default: B. One sentence on the rationale.
- Status: open
- Resolution: (filled in once dev confirms or overrides)
```

Keep `Q-NNN` IDs monotonically increasing. When a question resolves, leave the entry in place and update `Status: resolved` plus the `Resolution:` line. Never delete.
